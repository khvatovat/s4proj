# Workflow with branches

DON'T COMMIT OR PUSH TO MASTER

Create a new branch for each "feature".

It is recommended to create your new branch from master.
Little tutorial:
- Go on the command line and use `cd` to go to the main folder
- Ask git to go on the `master` branch: `git checkout master` (note: if there is an error, STOP THERE and fix it, usually you need to commit some work, THINK TWICE BEFORE RUNNING `git stash`, it will more or less forget what you did - I can get it back for you but please try not to do this error)
- Get the latest stuff from the `master` branch: `git pull`
- Actually create your new branch: `git switch -c my-super-cool-branch` (secret tip: replace `my-super-cool-branch` with the name of your new branch following this format: `[username]/[feature name]`)
- push for the first time, to create your new branch on the git server: `git push --set-upstream origin my-super-cool-branch`
- do stuff
- git add, git commit, and so on
- push
- message me on discord
