        <h2>Maria Khvatova</h2>
        <p>Having had some previous experience with image processing, I was delighted to take part in the developpment of this project. Specifically - to take care of the Fingerprint extraction process. Creating this project has taught me a lot about image treatment, security and teamwork, and I am grateful to be part of the BioGuard team!</p>
        <h2>Angel Van den akker</h2>
        <p>With a strong passion for both sports and coding, I balance an active lifestyle with rigorous academic pursuits. This unique combination fuels a disciplined approach to studies and a dynamic engagement in various projects.
            Outside the classroom, Angel is an active member of sports clubs, finding time to stay physically active and fostering a healthy balance between mental and physical well-being.
            I generally have a collaborative spirit and always a keen enthusiasm for learning, I contribute positively to group projects and am always eager to take on new challenges.</p>
